# Data-Mining-Project

In today’s digital age, where virtual interactions are integral
to daily life, ensuring secure and user-friendly authentication
methods is increasingly crucial. Traditional biometric sys-
tems—such as fingerprint, iris, and facial recognition—have
been widely deployed; however, they come with notable
limitations. These include privacy concerns, dependency on
specialized hardware, and susceptibility to spoofing attacks.
In contrast, textual data—generated through social media,
messaging platforms, and digital communications—remains
underutilized in biometric authentication. Text-based biomet-
rics, which rely on analyzing writing style, linguistic pat-
terns, and keystroke dynamics, offer a promising alternative.
However, they present unique challenges due to the dynamic
nature of language, individual styles, and evolving writing
behavior over time. This project aims to address the need for
a secure, scalable, and non-intrusive approach to biometric
authentication using textual data
